## Project: Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano

### Introduction
This project is a part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum aimed at teaching responsive web design principles through practical implementation.

The piano layout should adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes, demonstrating the importance of responsive design in web development.

### Project Structure
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the piano interface.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styling rules for the piano interface.

### How to Run

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the piano interface.
3. Experiment with resizing the browser window to observe the responsive behavior of the piano layout.
